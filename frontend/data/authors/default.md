## Definition of an _Opera-pre-neur_

Opera singer meets entrepreneur. Creativity meets impressario. Classical meets innovation. Art meets business.

In 2009, not long after singing on the world renowned Metropolitan Opera stage, my young career as an opera singer hit a major snag. The opera company I was working for (sixth-oldest in the nation) went bankrupt and I was overcome by the basic need to survive financially.

From that point on I have pursued a non-linear career path which has lead me here: a 'retired' opera singer turned creative technologist.

## Manifesto

As an artist, I constantly seek out perfection in my work. This pursuit can easily become a negative crutch. In that case, striving for perfection must be approached with balance and flexibility but never timidity or a lack of credible hubris. It must be pursued by remembering the past but always living in the present.

The purpose of my work is to communicate and connect to the intended audience. My passion lies within creating a personal experience for the modern day individual.

The work that comes across my _virtual_ desk passes through these 3 filters:
1. Past - acknowledging the good, the bad, and the ugly
2. Present - challenging the current paradigm
3. Future - defining the ideals

Within the pursuit of perfection lies the desire to become enlightened or changed. If that impulse is not present within the work, then the work is inherently pointless.
